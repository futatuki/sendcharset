---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roundcube plugin for customize character encoding of sending message.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Overview
This plugin adds a option to mail composing preference.
The option specifies which charset to be used in sending message.
If you specifies charset ISO-2022-*, B encoding is used for header and
transfer-encding is set to 7bit automatically.
If you specifies charset ISO-8859-*, Q encoding is used for header and
use Base64 encoding for MIME
For other charset, if 'use_base64' option is set, use B encoding for header
and use Base64 encoding for MIME instead of quoted-printable.

This plugin requires roundcubemail >= 1.2.0 (*)

(*) Handling of ISO-2022-* encoding on roundcubemail had been broken (#5640)
since fixed on master branch commit 402a4634488903d9ea13fac988b3c7fcd4ec7c0d
(Jun 29 2017), but this plugin of this branch don't fix it.
For roundcubemail before it fixed, please use the plugin of another branch
with code to fix it, or apply change on
https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail.git ,
commit 6f87a320528f21f5804620dfa74e8ce7c2dafb63 and
commit 402a4634488903d9ea13fac988b3c7fcd4ec7c0d
against program/steps/mail/sendmail.inc .

* Installation
Put this plugin as plugins/sendcharset, then edit config.inc.php
in roundcube config directory:

For users, each user can these options by prerefences menu,
    preferences> message composition>
        main option> Charset for message to send
for sendcharset option, and
    preferences> message composition>

for use_base64 option.

If you don't want to show users these options, set its option name
into $config['dont_override'] option array, like

   $config['dont_override'][] = 'sendcharset';
   $config['dont_override'][] = 'use_base64';
